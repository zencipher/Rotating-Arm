### Note of Warning
Instructors are beginning to use [MOSS](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/) to catch cheaters. If you are a student looking here with the intent of copying this code, proceed with caution. Considering that this project in particular requires the creation of an **_original object_** (even if you load in premade models), it would be blatantly obvious if you use this code for reference, **HOWEVER**, using this as reference for rotations, transformations, and ~~camera modes~~ is perfectly fine.
